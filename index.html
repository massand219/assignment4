                <h3><a href="index2.html">Puggies</a></h3>
                	<p>I absolutely love puggies. Pugs are my favorite breed of dogs. I love all puggies: teacups, regular, black, white and black, tan, brown. Any color and any size. Pugs are just my fave. Puggies are just so adorable. I feel like puggies are the dogs with the real "puppy dog face."</p>

                <h3><a href="article.html">Kittens</a></h3>
                    <p>Kittens and cats are just so adorable. I love them all too! While doggies show you love and affection right off the bat, kittens and cats take a bit warming up to. Which is a lot like how I am. Kittens are also very, very selective about who they show their affection to. And they're attention seeking. (As am I). Kittens are just so fiesty. I love them.</p>

                <h3><a href="index3.html">Sports</a></h3>
                	<p>I love basketball. I've been watching basketball since the young age of 5. I'm a Chicago Bulls fan. Since I'm too short to play (I'm only 4'11"), I practice my love for basketball by watching NBA games, and by writing sports analyses. I'm also starting to like football. My favorite player is Odell Beckham Jr., he's a wide reciever on the New York Giants.</p>
